1. Project Description

This project is a corporate website for a company that provides international medical assistance, concierge services, translation, private administration for healthcare providers, and local guidance.
The website will present the company’s services, values, and contact channels, while also supporting multilingual translation (English, French, Portuguese) through a language toggle.

The theme will be white and green (green = life, health, growth).
The website will be responsive and easy to navigate, built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.


2. Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

Practice React + TypeScript for building modular, type-safe UI components.

Learn how to use TailwindCSS for styling and responsive design.

Implement i18n (internationalization) with libraries like react-i18next.

Learn routing in React with react-router-dom.

Build a contact form (with basic validation and email handling simulation).

Practice organizing a multi-page project structure.

Learn best practices for project documentation and code maintainability.

4. Best Practices

Component reusability: split UI into components (Navbar, Footer, ServiceCard, LanguageToggle, etc.).

Clean folder structure: components/, pages/, assets/, i18n/.

Type safety: define interfaces for props.

Responsive design: test across devices.

Accessibility: semantic HTML, alt text for images, contrast-friendly colors.


5. Implementation Guide
Step 1: Project Setup
npx create-react-app medical-company --template typescript
cd medical-company
npm install tailwindcss react-router-dom react-i18next i18next
npx tailwindcss init -p

Commit often: push changes to GitHub with meaningful commit messages.

Step 2: Project Structure
/src
  /assets
  /components
    Navbar.tsx
    Footer.tsx
    ServiceCard.tsx
    LanguageToggle.tsx
  /pages
    Home.tsx
    About.tsx
    Services.tsx
    Contact.tsx
  /i18n
    en.json
    fr.json
    pt.json
  App.tsx
  index.tsx

Step 3: Routing

Use react-router-dom for navigation (Home, About, Services, Contact).


Step 4: Layout & Styling

Navbar: Logo, Links, Language Toggle

Hero section: slogan + image

Services grid: ServiceCard components

Contact form: form inputs styled with Tailwind

Step 5: Language Support

Add i18n.js setup with react-i18next.

Example en.json:

{
  "home": {
    "title": "Welcome to Our Company",
    "subtitle": "We provide international medical assistance and support."
  }
}

Add fr.json and pt.json.

Use useTranslation() hook in components.

Step 6: Contact Form

Inputs: Name, Email, Message.

Validation (simple required fields).

For now: log data in console or display success message.

Step 7: Deployment

Deploy to Vercel or Netlify for free hosting.


6. Expected Outcome

At the end, you’ll have a professional, responsive, multilingual company website with:
✅ Home, About, Services, Contact pages
✅ Clean UI with Tailwind styling
✅ Language toggle (English, French, Portuguese)
✅ Contact form
✅ Responsive and accessible design
✅ Hosted live version you can share in your portfolio


7. Extra Suggestions
